# Quizes

The best way to learn a concept is learning by practicing it. Here is a bunch of quizes that will help you to practice the JavaScript Asynchronous programming concepts. I hope you find it helpful. In case of any doubts or clarifications, please reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tapasadhikary) over DM.

## What's the output of this code?

  ```js
  function f1() {
    console.log('f1');
  }

  console.log("Let's do it!");

  setTimeout(function() {console.log('in settimeout');}, 0);

  f1();
  f1();
  f1();
  f1();
  ```
Options are,
- Let's do it!, in settimeout, f1, f1, f1, f1
- Let's do it!, f1, f1, f1, f1, in settimeout
- Let's do it!, f1, , in settimeout, f1, f1, f1 



## Which are `true`? 
- [ ] JavaScript is single-threaded
- [ ] By default, JavaScript is synchrnous
- [ ] Only promises make JavaScript asynchronous
- [ ] All function callbacks are asynchronous
